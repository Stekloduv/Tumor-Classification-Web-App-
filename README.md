# Tumor-Classification-Web-App
This is a machine learning-based image classification service. It uses a neural network trained on a labeled dataset to classify images of tumors. 

The model was trained and evaluated in a [Google Colab Service](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_BPWyiiqaT8FPWj_8JEWmX1-HmkiwrVa?usp=sharing).
The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing.
- Model training.
- Model evaluation achieving [90>=% accuracy].
